CVE-2024-50592

An attacker with local access the to medical office computer can 
escalate his Windows user privileges to "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" by 
exploiting a race condition in the Elefant Update Service during the 
repair or update process. When using the repair function, the service queries the server for a 
list of files and their hashes. In addition, instructions to execute 
binaries to finalize the repair process are included. The executables are executed as "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" after they are 
copied over to the user writable installation folder (C:\Elefant1). This
 means that a user can overwrite either "PostESUUpdate.exe" or 
"Update_OpenJava.exe" in the time frame after the copy and before the 
execution of the final repair step. The overwritten executable is then executed as "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM". Published:

CVE-2024-50593

An attacker with local access to the medical office computer can

CVE-2024-50591

An attacker with local access the to medical office computer can 
escalate his Windows user privileges to "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" by 
exploiting a command injection vulnerability in the Elefant Update 
Service. The command injection can be exploited by communicating with 
the Elefant Update Service which is running as "SYSTEM" via Windows 
Named Pipes.The Elefant Software Updater (ESU) consists of two components. An ESU
 service which runs as "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" and an ESU tray client 
which communicates with the service to update or repair the installation
 and is running with user permissions. The communication is implemented 
using named pipes. A crafted message of type 
"MessageType.SupportServiceInfos" can be sent to the local ESU service 
to inject commands, which are then executed as "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM". Published:

CVE-2024-50590

Attackers with local access to the medical office computer can 
escalate their Windows user privileges to "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" by 
overwriting one of two Elefant service binaries with weak permissions. The default installation directory of Elefant is "C:\Elefant1" which is 
writable for all users. In addition, the Elefant installer registers two
 Firebird database services which are running as “NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM”. 

Path: C:\Elefant1\Firebird_2\bin\fbserver.exe

Path: C:\Elefant1\Firebird_2\bin\fbguard.exe


Both service binaries are user writable. This means that a local 
attacker can rename one of the service binaries, replace the service 
executable with a new executable, and then restart the system. Once the 
system has rebooted, the new service binary is executed as "NT 
AUTHORITY\SYSTEM". Published:

CVE-2024-50211

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

udf: refactor inode_bmap() to handle error

Refactor inode_bmap() to handle error since udf_next_aext() can return
error now. On situations like ftruncate, udf_extend_file() can now
detect errors and bail out early without resorting to checking for
particular offsets and assuming internal behavior of these functions. Published:

CVE-2024-50210

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

posix-clock: posix-clock: Fix unbalanced locking in pc_clock_settime()

If get_clock_desc() succeeds, it calls fget() for the clockid's fd,
and get the clk->rwsem read lock, so the error path should release
the lock to make the lock balance and fput the clockid's fd to make
the refcount balance and release the fd related resource.

However the below commit left the error path locked behind resulting in
unbalanced locking. Check timespec64_valid_strict() before
get_clock_desc() to fix it, because the "ts" is not changed
after that.
